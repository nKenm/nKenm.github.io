  <h1>My website is all about PC Building</h1>

  <p>I have a strong <strong>love</strong> to building PC. When I go to micro-center I always seem to want to buy new hardware <em>every</em> time I go, no matter if I don't specifically need it, I always seem to want it.</p>

  <h2>What Components should you pay attention to build a PC?</h2>


  <p>The Hardware I pay attention when looking into a pc are...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Motherboard</li>
    <li>Grahpics Card</li>
    <li>CPU</li>
    <li>RAM</li>
    <li>Power Supply</li>
    <li>SSD/HDD/NvMe Storage</li>
    <li>CPU Cooler</li>
    <li>Case Fans</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Edam says</h3>

  <p>Edam believes the AMD Ryze 9 5950X is the best CPU...</p>

  <h3>Stilton <em>Doubts </em></h3>

  <p>Stilton believes the intel Core i9-10980XE is better than Edams CPU <em>choice</em>.</p>


  <h3>Over-Simplified Version to build a PC</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring out the Motherboard and CPU of choice and place it in the socket.</li>
    <li><strong>Before</strong> putting the motherboard in the case take this time to do some cable management in the case, place in the case Fans, power supply cables,  <em>if</em> you have a radiator also begin positioning it <strong>AND</strong> if your motherboard includes a IO Shield make sure to place it before putting in the motherboard in the case.</li>
    <li>Once the cable management is done place in your motherboard to its respective place <strong>WITH</strong> motherboard standoffs attached, if you do not do this you may short circuit your board and ruin it. </li>
    <li>After it begin placing the RAM slots in their position, they should not be next to each other but space out from one another.</li>
    <li>Once done make sure you put in the CPU Cooler with either the thermal paste that is pre-applied to it or.</li>
    <li>After that put in the graphics card into the first PCIE x 16 slot to use the full bandwidth.</li>
    <li>Look for the HDD/SSD location on your Case and plug in the power and SATA cables from the drive to motherboard, depending how many you bought.</li>
    <li>Finally plug in the 24+2 power pin connector to the motherboard, usually located at the right-upper side of the board and the CPU power in the Left-upper side. And plug in the power cord into the GPU, unless it does require one.</li>
    <li>Now you may turn on your PC and hope for the BIOS logo, if it does you have successfully build a computer, if not then it'll be troubleshooting time.</li>
  </ol>
